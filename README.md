#Convolutional Neural Network Demo

Step 1: Download pre-trained word embeddings and save them in a directory called glove.6B in the root
GloVe embedding data can be found at:
http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip
(source page: http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)

Step 2: Train the neural network and save the model in the Keras_Train Jupyter Notebook

Step 3: Reload the saved model and use it in the Keras_Reload_Model Jupyter Notebook
